# Multiplane-Calibration-Example

This is an example of a 3D multiplane calibration using 3 cameras and a reference grid at 4 different levels.
The measurements were done by Lukas Engelen in the confluence flume of the Hydraulics Laboratory of Ghent University in Belgium.
The calibration images are already post-processed using ImageJ to enhance detection of the calibration dots.
Additionally ,they are already corrected for camera distortion so there is no need to include any distortion coefficients during calibration.
In the man_ori.par-files of the different planes, you will see which points of the 22X30 pattern are depicted by each camera at the different heights.
A pciture of the setup and sketch (will be updated when I have the time) of the coordinate system are added for clarification.
